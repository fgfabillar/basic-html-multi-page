                    <div class="humbertext">
                        <p>Multimedia Design and Development is one of two programs within Humber’s interaction and design common platform cluster. The first semester of this program is shared with the three-year Graphic Design program. This offers students exposure to the different areas of programming, common elements of design and creative thinking, and collaborative work with students studying to work in complementary career fields.
                        <br>
                        <br>Greater exposure to the ever-evolving and exciting world of design and development will allow students to investigate the edges of this area of study, and then students will confirm their focus prior to the second semester of study.</p>

                        <h2>Why choose the program?</h2>
                        <p>Students cultivate important collaborative teamwork and project management skills through group assignments both within this program and through interdisciplinary work with students in sister programs. This prepares students for collaborative projects in the field and helps students gain a real-world perspective on the nature of multimedia work. Students prepare to pursue new media opportunities by developing a comprehensive portfolio that they can present to potential employers or clients, and they are exposed to entrepreneurial opportunities open to professionals in this rich field. Students in this program also build real-world user experience skills using Humber’s unique, mobile usability lab and through a field experience.
                        <br>
                        <br>Under the guidance of experienced and knowledgeable professors, students learn on and become experienced with industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, XD, Audition and Premiere. Web technologies such as HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS and MongoDB. These are employed in hands-on learning situations in our applied teaching environment with relevant industry projects.</p>
